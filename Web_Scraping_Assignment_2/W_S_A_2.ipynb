       "20  iphone 11 is a very good phone to buy only if you can compromise for the display. The display on this is device is pretty good but you can get other options with better displays in this price segment. If you can survive with an HD+ LCD panel with thicker bezels and a notch up top then this is a very good phone for you. Cameras are awesome, battery backup excellent, great performance and a decent premium look. Good job Apple !                                                                                   \n",
