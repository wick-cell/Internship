       "152  Ingrid 1 year ago For me this song is the perfect representation of that feeling we have when we're in love and we're finally getting close to kiss the person we love! All the butterflies in our stomach, that feeling of tension, that feeling of comfy unease, and then, at the same time, of extreme joy when we finally get to be so close to someone we're attracted to  This song represents falling in love for me! I love how music can describe feelings without words, it's magical!  126 REPLY                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "201  Edén Muratalla 5 months ago I used to hear this song just to feel my cheeks warming up while remembering a girl who made me feel the illusion of finally finding the right person to walk along with through so many years. That illusion died the day I realized she was only looking for my wallet. It happened again, nothing was real. It's like a curse that always makes me fail in love with girls who only play with me. But this time I decided to change things, so I decided to end up our friendship. Yes, maybe now I'm alone, but no one will harm me this time. Still enjoy the song, but now gives me a bitter taste.

I'm so tired of people in everyone else's business. It's like people have to find a reason to hate on someone or their day isn't completed.

       "446  Kaitlyn Anderson 7 years ago No, for everyone saying that gay couples etc. don't belong in this video should just leave. That's what today's society is and people have the right to love who they love. This video isn't primarily made of gay couples because it's showing that they're just as equal to straight couples. By mixing them it shows that everyone's equal and deserves the same rights as anyone else. Don't judge  people for who they love. It's none of your business so get the fuck outta it.  94 REPLY                                                                                                                             \n",

I am straight, but seeing the two girls kiss and those two guys staring at each other is at least giving me hope that people my age (teens) will become more open towards same sex couples if they see it in a popular music video. ^-^ And that the music industrial isn't so geared towards straight couples. :P 235 REPLY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
